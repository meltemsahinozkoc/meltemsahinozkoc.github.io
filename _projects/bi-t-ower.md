BI-T-OWER reimagines Ankara's underutilized shopping malls as public-facing data farms—urban infrastructures that store, generate, and share data while serving as energy hubs. It proposes a hybrid typology that integrates public programs with data centers, making data production a civic act. By transforming malls into localized centers of digital and cultural memory, the project envisions a future where data infrastructure fosters urban sustainability, collective memory, and digital public space.
